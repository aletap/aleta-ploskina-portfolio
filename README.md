## About Me | Senior QA Engineer to Applied AI / Python Developer

I am a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer with over 15 years of experience
building, validating, and scaling reliable software systems in enterprise and
regulated environments.

My background includes designing automation frameworks, integrating testing
into CI/CD pipelines, validating APIs and data layers, and partnering closely
with engineering and product teams to reduce risk and improve delivery speed.

I am now intentionally expanding into Python development and Applied AI
engineering, focusing on building practical, production-minded systems.
My strengths lie in data validation, system reliability, API behavior,
and verifying that intelligent systems behave correctly, consistently,
and safely.

This combination allows me to approach AI-enabled systems not just as a
developer, but as an engineer who understands failure modes, edge cases,
and real-world constraints.
