<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I’m a results-driven Senior Quality Assurance Engineer with 15+ years of experience leading QA strategy, championing test automation, and delivering software that exceeds user expectations across highly regulated industries.</p>
  <p>Deeply committed to continuous learning, I’m currently pursuing professional certifications in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science to expand my impact in data-driven and intelligent systems.</p>
  <p>My technical expertise spans Playwright automation frameworks, API and database (SQL) validation, performance testing, CI/CD pipelines, DevOps integration, and Python scripting. I spearheaded automation adoption by building the first automated test suites within teams, dramatically reducing manual effort and accelerating regression cycles.</p>
  <p>My career includes hands-on leadership across complex data migration initiatives, cloud-based application testing on Amazon Web Services (AWS), React-based web applications, accessibility testing, mobile and web platforms, and educational tools, consistently aligning QA strategy with enterprise risk management, compliance requirements, and customer experience priorities.</p>
  <p>As a Certified SDET, ISTQB CTFL, and PSM I, I’m passionate about mentoring teams, embedding Agile principles, and fostering a culture of quality ownership and innovation. Known for my scrappy, test-to-break mindset and resilience under pressure, I excel at transforming complex challenges into production-ready, high-quality solutions.</p>
  <p>I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments and love pushing quality forward in meaningful, user-focused ways.</p>
